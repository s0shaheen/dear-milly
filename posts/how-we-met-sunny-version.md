# How we met (Sunny's version)

It's funny that the first day we met would be so difficult to explain to an outsider, purely out of cringeworthiness. I thought I'd meet the girl of my dreams on an airplane or at Brew Lab; Joe's Bollywood night during my senior year of college was a surprise, to say the least.

I had just come off my Pub Cycle with OTCR board (which explains my condition) and headed to Joe's with drunken steps and a thoughtless mind. It would be comforting to believe that I went to Bollywood Night having received a free ticket, but there's a possibility I bought it. Maybe listening to Ghungroo with a vodka cran in hand amongst a cesspool of sweat is a guilty pleasure of mine.

Once at Joe's, I meandered around giving my usual formalities to people I've worked with or have had classes with. Pretty usual routine as I waited for my own entourage of friends to arrive. One vivid memory of these couple hours was when I was sitting with the OTCR partners, the lot of which were harassing me regarding the lack of romance in my life.

"Sunny, when are we going to get to see you with a girl?"

I replied with one of my many dismissive excuses to change the subject: "I'll think about it after I get into Y Combinator."

To which the group let out a hesitant laugh. My jokes don't land the same way when I'm backed into a corner.

*It was a touchy matter for me at the time and for a couple years preceding that. I wasn't ready to open myself up to the idea of dating. Sitting with myself and understanding why was a herculean task that frankly took longer than I wished. But back to the story at hand...*

Thankfully, I was able to find refuge in some friends who had made their way to Joe's. It was quite fun to sit out on the patio and reminisce about BNights prior. It was only September of our senior year, and I don't think the finality of the time had hit us yet.

I had run back inside to grab a couple drinks while our tender was still there. Deep down, I knew this would be my last time at Joe's and was determined to indulge in as many watery Baja Blast wells as I could. When I came back out to the patio, I saw Aniketh and Aneek slamming some cigarettes with a girl I hadn't seen before. As usual, I rushed over to see if I could con my way into a dart as well. It worked.

Once I had secured my own cigarette, I noticed that Aniketh and Aneek had left the scene, leaving just this nicotine dealer and myself. Out of politeness, I went through my smalltalk formalities: your name (Milly - sick nickname), your major (Political Science & Psychology - goated green flag), your religion (Muslim - hold on...), your nationality (Pakistani and Indian - I'm hooked). Being the nonchalant and stoic guy that I am, I mentally slapped myself into composure, knowing that I was talking to a true gem in the middle of Joe's.

I thought I was doing a good job of keeping myself cool and collected until I realized that your eye contact was amazingly steady. Barring the fact that it's easy to get lost in your eyes, I was instantly enamored by your ability to commit to a conversation. I'm a yapper through and through, but typically refrain from personal conversations with random folks. Something about you instantly caused me to let my guard down. We were posted up by that fence talking about school, family, our views on browntown and friends, your cigarette collection, and our shared experience of nicknames. I thought the girls that came and scammed us out of our own cigarettes or the expected interruption by Maaz would cause you to find your friends, but I was pleasantly surprised that you were equally entertained by our conversation.

As we've discussed thoroughly, my game/rizz/flattery are far from satisfactory. But I didn't want to risk losing you or myself to the crowd, so I hesitantly asked you for a drink (despite the fact that you had shared that you were done for the night, whoops). We were sharing a couple jaeger bombs (which you proceeded to chug) when a Trilogy song started playing and we professed our love for the weekend‚Äîthis was my 500 Days of Summer moment.

I'm not going to lie, I was panicking a bit at this point‚Äîthis was uncharted territory in terms of bar conversations. I watched my words very carefully as I asked you respectfully if you wanted to grab food with me, expecting you to use that as your exit point. Next thing I know, we're walking over to the taco truck (an absolutely rare occurrence for me) and heading over to my apartment.

This was unfathomable‚Äîyou just met me?! And you were down to watch movie trailers together?!?! I was just happy to have made a lovely new friend during what would have been a mediocre night. Coming from Batman herself, I still think you're wrong about The Dark Knight being the best Batman movie. But alas, I still ended up making a fool of myself by trying to show you my collection of books and getting asked, "So how many of these have you actually read?" I was just trying to show off my scholarly side ü§ì. It felt like we could talk about practically anything, especially the topics that nobody else would even think about (REL 263!)

*It was sometime around now that I realized that we had fully met before‚Äîat Joe's Bollywood Night the year before. I don't think I brought it up to you then out of fear of ruining my self-image too soon (aka, I was incomprehensible that night). Absolutely abysmal small talk that consisted of "oh you're from Pakistan too... nice." But hey, maybe Bollywood Night will be our always.*

It was far too late into the night to let you walk home on your own. I was honored that you let me walk you back to your lobby and allow me to fail at pool. Even more honored that you invited me to see your balcony‚Äîyou have no idea how nervous I was.

Looking out over the balcony (aka safety hazard), I got to learn more about your views on religion, spirituality, career, college, movies, and so much more. It's rare to find someone like you who has poignant, nuanced takes on so many facets of life; it's even rarer for them to look like you. You have a way of speaking that's incredibly engaging‚Äîpolite yet direct and banterful. Maybe I was the one who got rizzed on.

Surprisingly enough, I'm a romantic deep down. I grew up watching the love stories of SRK and Aamir Khan, YA novels from John Green, horribly written Muslim romance stories on Wattpad. I couldn't help but visualize what a life with you would look like (sorry so cheesy). I had a gut feeling that I was talking to someone incredibly out of my league.

It was 4AM by the time I realized that I was inches from entirely losing my voice or falling asleep on your balcony, and that's when you saw my first idiotic, mind-boggling event: walking out without getting your number. And I proceeded to make countless incomprensible, stupid mistakes over the next 8 months: closing myself off for weeks, only to end up running into you again at Kams (I'm still sorry for the Black Mirror "Hang the DJ" reference), where I ended up losing my keys at your place. Coming back to retrieve my keys only to forget my backpack. All the times I forgot to call you back, lost track of time, couldn't be present for you, couldn't be courageous enough to bring up difficult conversations - much to your frustration and disapointment. Sometimes I'd feel flawed to the core and incapable of change.

I also proceeded to have the 8 best months of my life. You showed me your world‚Äîyour love of cooking for your friends, your taste in movies and music, your incredibly cute passion for reading and scrapbooking, your tools for navigating tough life moments and stressors. You taught me about simple, heartwarming gestures like flowers or coffee, as well as the fun of planning a date. I learned from watching how you approach life with deliberate intent and hard work in everything you do. You taught me the value of my own time and how to value others'. You emphasized the importance of showing my intentions through actions rather than words. I found myself taking better care of myself, being more forgiving of myself, and learning how to be more reliable and supportive for those I care about. You allow me to bring my whole self in front of you - the good, the bad, and the ugly (and uglier) - I've never felt so seen before. 

By showing me the beauty in your own life, I've begun to appreciate and be grateful for the beauty in my own. That gift on its own is priceless (on top of the countless thoughtful gifts I've received from you). Through you, I've gained more conviction in my own goals for the future and motivation for the present. Thank you for all the growth you've supported me through. I hope I can be a catalyst for your own personal growth.

We conquered Joe's (twice) and I hope we can conquer the rest of the world too.

Okay cheesiness done.

‚ù§Ô∏è, Sunny
