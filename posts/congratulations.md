# Congratulations!

*‚ÄúMilly loves school‚Äù*


I wrote this down on a post-it note in the early days of getting to know you, alongside your runner-up hobbies including Nerds Clusters and green tea. Whether you realize it or not, your passion for education and learning is one of a kind. Most folks (including myself) tend to either:

- (a) dislike school and its disguised forms of training us for matrix 9-5ing  
- (b) masquerade their way into tolerating school (think beautiful Notion boards, color-coded notes, silly gen eds)

While likely a symptom of my network, you‚Äôre the first person I met in college that speaks with full honor and conviction for their academics. Your unbound curiosity is made clear in your dedication towards any pursuit ‚Äî whether it's *PSYC 210* or *STAT 100* or *REL 260*; no matter the mundanity or utility of the subject at hand. It has been a gift to watch your eyes light up from the love of learning.

We both know this journey is not nearly over; this next chapter of yours will have you battling teacherhood and online Master‚Äôs courses. No one is better suited for this challenge than you. I envy the students that have the privilege to be under your tutelage. The impact of teachers isn‚Äôt measured in just lesson plans and assignments, but also the signals of kindness and care that lie between the lines. Osmosis will empower your pupils in the same way it has for myself. 

Let me share a few learnings that you‚Äôve imparted on me over the last 20+ months.

### 1. **Take radical ownership of your wellbeing**

Your field of study may have given you a slight edge on this skill, but it's no small feat to build a toolkit of mental wellness and maintenance. I admire how quickly you can triage your emotions and thoughts, followed by an even quicker solution. You take continual strides to be the sole, unencumbered pilot of your soul, and that quality will let you smoothly ride through life's challenges while slowing down to enjoy the deserved moments (such as this one‚Äîyour grad party!).

I spent a good part of my life confusing illnesses like detachment and compartmentalization as "self-awareness" and "emotional intelligence." From you, I've learned the art of gardening your mindscape through consistent practices. From you, I've learned to exhale longer, relax deeper, and think with greater clarity.

### 2. **Listen, show, AND tell.**

Similar to the aforementioned gardening, relationships need constant watering as well. But unlike the simple dopamine and mindfulness tricks that work on one's own mind, the calculus of nurturing a bond between two people can feel especially formidable. Terms like "love languages" and "emotional labor" have scared me before ‚Äî is the practice of maintaining relationships not accessible to all? Your approach to navigating our relationship, as well as your friendships and family bonds, has democratized this science for me:

1. *Listen* intently to the other person. Beyond mere hearing, you've taught me to absorb the spaces between their sentences and the weight of their silences.  
2. *Show* your love for them in ways that they feel it best. You've demonstrated how attuning to someone's unique reception of care ‚Äî or even just attempting to ‚Äî is a powerful signal of love.  
3. *Tell* them your ways of love, for words go a long way. Verbal affirmation and explanation is just as necessary as actions and intentions. You taught me to articulate my feelings and vocalize my appreciation, but also to speak on the uncomfortable and unclear topics that ultimately make us stronger.

It isn‚Äôt easy, but it is simple. While it‚Äôs taken me many trials and errors to understand these basic principles, I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the most patient and supportive teacher.

### 3. **Learning is a lifelong endeavor.**

I spent the better part of my post-grad year ‚Äúdecompressing myself‚Äù from the sensory and information overload of 16 years of school. This is largely a farce ‚Äî a way to hide behind my fear of failing and stupidity. My adolescent self wasn‚Äôt humble enough to develop the learning muscles that could‚Äôve improved my GPA, grown from my mistakes, or empowered my ideas and ambitions.

You‚Äôve opposed this lifelong limitation of mine with ideals that are void of arrogance and insecurity: wonder and curiosity. You let your instincts and inclinations pull you in their direction before anxiety has a chance to reel you back. Your adventures down life‚Äôs less-traveled tributaries and streams ‚Äî TFA, liberal arts, even museum curation one day ‚Äî are the antithesis to my more structured and methodological approaches. I‚Äôm inspired by you *every single day*. I aspire to be as amazing of a teacher and student as you are.

Congratulations on graduating, and more importantly, for taking on the challenges and adventures over the last 4 years with inquisitiveness and gratitude. I can‚Äôt wait to build a whimsical life with you ü§©

‚ù§Ô∏è, Sunny
